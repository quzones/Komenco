    "Shor’s algorithm is famous for factoring integers in polynomial time. Since the best-known classical algorithm requires greater-than-polynomial time to factor the product of two primes, the widely used cryptographic protocol, RSA, relies on factoring being impossible for large enough integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we will focus on the quantum part of Shor’s algorithm, which actually solves the problem of _period finding_. Since a factoring problem can be turned into a period finding problem in polynomial time, an efficient period finding algorithm can be used to factor integers efficiently too. For now its enough to show that if we can compute the period of $a^x\\bmod N$ efficiently, then we can also efficiently factor. Since period finding is a worthy problem in its own right, we will first solve this, then discuss how this can be used to factor in section 5."
