This is an SDK for our Komenco Quantum Simulator. Its an entry level product that can support upto 30-33 Qubits and gives reasonable results. And is very light on the pocket even if you want a dedicated instance. So its a great way for a company or a university to get started.

The IP Address included in this SDK points to a Trial Version of the Komenco Quantum Simulator. Which supports only 15 Qubits and is a shared instance which is just meant to be used to get a feel of what Quantum Computing is all about. Using Quantum Circuit and Gate based Quantum Computers and Quantum Simulators.

Typically customers who want to seriously adopt Quantum Computing would normally purchase one or more instances of our dedicated Quantum Simulators which support ~300 Qubits or our Quantum Computers which support Millions of "Logical" Qubits. So these are the best options to go with.

But Quantum Simulators and Computers are expensive they cost double or triple digit millions of dollars. 

These are some of our offerings:

Komenco - tiny entry level simulator 30-33 Qubits 
Anhelo - production grade simulator ~300 Qubits
Querido - quantum AI 1000 Logical Qubits
Simp√°tico - quantum computer
Encantado - quantum gravity computer 
Carero - Quantum Annealer 

1 Week Trials of Anhelo (50 Qubits) and Carero (1m Qubits QUBO, QAOA, ISING Solver) is available exclusively for existing customers of our Komenco SDK.
